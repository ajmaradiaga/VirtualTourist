# VirtualTourist
Project created as part of Udacity iOS Nanodegree - Project 4: Virtual Tourist App

Submitted: 2015-04-18

## Project Description
Create an app that downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app will allow users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.
